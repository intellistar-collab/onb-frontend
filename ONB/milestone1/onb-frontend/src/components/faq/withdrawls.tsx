      <h2>Withdrawals</h2>
      <p>
        This section explains how customers can access and manage their tokens,
        items, or experiences after opening mystery boxes, including exchange
        options and timelines.
      </p>
      <h3>How do I claim my items?</h3>
      <p>
        When you open a mystery box, your tokens, items, or experiences are automatically credited to your
        account. View them in your "Pack" section. Tokens can be used to purchase
        more boxes, items are shipped to your registered address, and experiences
        (e.g., event tickets, travel vouchers, holidays) are arranged via email
        with our OneNightBox team. If you don't want an item or experience, you
        can exchange it for tokens via the "Pack" section within 14 days. Contact
        support at support@onenightbox.com for assistance.
      </p>
      <h3>What are the item claim methods?</h3>
      <p>
        Tokens are available instantly in your "Pack" section for
        purchasing more boxes. Items are shipped to your registered address via
        trusted couriers (e.g., FedEx, DHL), and experiences are sent as digital
        vouchers via email or arranged via email with our OneNightBox team.
        Availability of specific items or experiences may depend on your region.
        Check your "Pack" section for details or contact support at
        support@onenightbox.com.
      </p>
      <h3>How long does it take to receive my items?</h3>
      <p>
        Tokens are available instantly in your "Pack" section. Items are shipped
        within 7-14 business days, depending on your location and item
        availability. We'll contact you if delays occur. Experiences are arranged
        within 7 business days via email, with delivery times varying by
        experience (e.g., event tickets depend on the event date). You'll receive
        tracking or confirmation details in your "Pack" section or via email.
        Contact support at support@onenightbox.com for updates.
      </p>
      <h3>Is there a minimum item amount to claim?</h3>
      <p>
        There's no minimum for claiming items. All tokens,
        items, and experiences, regardless of value, are credited to your account
        and can be used, shipped, or arranged. If you wish to exchange an item or
        experience, you can do so for tokens within 14 days via your "Pack"
        section.
      </p>
      <h3>Do I need to verify my identity to claim items?</h3>
      <p>
        For security, we may request identity verification (e.g., photo ID or proof of address)
        before shipping high-value items or arranging certain experiences, such as
        travel vouchers, events, and stays. This keeps your items safe.
        Verification is typically requested once and takes 1-2 business days.
        Contact support at support@onenightbox.com if you have questions.
