      <h2>Box Items</h2>
      <p>
        This section explains what customers can receive from mystery boxes, how items and experiences are delivered, and related policies.
      </p>
      <h3>What kinds of items can I receive?</h3>
      <p>
        You can receive tokens, physical items (e.g., smartphones, sneakers, gaming consoles, clothing, watches), or experiences (e.g., event tickets, travel vouchers, holidays). Each box lists the items and experiences with their odds of receiving each, so you are aware before purchasing.
      </p>
      <h3>How are items delivered?</h3>
      <p>
        Physical items are shipped to your registered address within 7-14 business days, depending on location and item availability. We'll contact you if delays occur. Experiences are sent as digital vouchers or arranged via email within 7 business days. Tokens are credited instantly to your "Wallet." Check your "Pack" section or via email for tracking or confirmation details.
      </p>
      <h3>Are there shipping fees for items?</h3>
      <p>
        A 25-token fee applies per shipment for physical items, confirmed at checkout. For international deliveries or oversized items, we'll notify you of any additional token fees before shipping. Experiences and tokens have no shipping costs, as they're delivered digitally or credited to your "Wallet." Contact support@onenightbox.com for details.
      </p>
      <h3>Can I exchange or return an item?</h3>
      <p>
        Items and experiences can be exchanged for tokens via your "Pack" section within 14 days. Defective items can be returned within 14 days for a replacement, subject to our Return Policy. Contact support@onenightbox.com for assistance.
      </p>
      <h3>What happens if I don't claim my item?</h3>
      <p>
        You must claim your item or experience within 14 days via your "Pack" section. Tokens are automatically credited to your "Wallet" and expire after one year of account inactivity. Unclaimed items or experiences may be forfeited.
