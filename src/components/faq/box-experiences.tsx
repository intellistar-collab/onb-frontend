      <h2>Box Experiences</h2>
      <p>
        This section covers the unique experiences you can receive from mystery
        boxes and how they work.
      </p>
      <h3>What are experiences?</h3>
      <p>
        Experiences are special items that can be won, all necessary bookings for the trip are included,
        example being a 3-day Abu Dhabi F1 race weekend for two, a city getaway,
        or booking of a particular activity. Each box lists what's included in
        their description and the chances of receiving the item, so you know
        what's possible before buying.
      </p>
      <h3>How are experiences arranged?</h3>
      <p>
        We'll email you within 7 business days to begin scheduling your experience (e.g.,
        event or travel dates) to fit your availability and any event timing. You
        may win an event which takes place several months after where we will make
        the necessary arrangements, booking of travel, accommodation and tickets
        where required. Details are in your "Pack" section of your account.
        Contact support@onenightbox.com for help and more information.
      </p>
      <h3>What's included in the experiences?</h3>
      <p>
        Experiences are all-inclusive, covering
        flights, hotels, spending money, and event costs (e.g., F1 tickets). Full
        details are listed in the box description before purchase.
      </p>
      <h3>Can I exchange an experience?</h3>
      <p>
        You can exchange an experience for tokens or, with our
        team's approval, another experience within 14 days by emailing us. See the
        Items section for exchange details or contact support@onenightbox.com.
      </p>
      <h3>Are there restrictions or issues with experiences?</h3>
      <p>
        Experiences may have age
        (18/21+), regional (U.S., Canada, Europe), or event-specific limits, noted
        in the box description. If issues arise (e.g., scheduling conflicts),
        contact support@onenightbox.com for solutions or a token exchange within
        14 days.
