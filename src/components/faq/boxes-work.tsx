      <h2>How Boxes Work</h2>
      <p>
        This section explains how mystery boxes work, their fairness, and what to
        expect when purchasing them.
      </p>
      <h3>How do mystery boxes work?</h3>
      <p>
        Select a box from our catalog and purchase it using tokens from your "Wallet." Once
        purchased, reveal your item, experience, or additional tokens, credited to
        your "Pack" (items/experiences) or "Wallet" (tokens). Each box lists
        potential items (e.g., smartphones, sneakers, clothing, watches) or
        experiences (e.g., event tickets, travel vouchers, holidays) with their
        likelihood of receiving each, so you know what you might get before
        buying.
      </p>
      <h3>Are the boxes fair?</h3>
      <p>
        Yes! Our boxes use a certified Random Number Generator (RNG) to ensure every purchase is random and unbiased. The
        likelihood of receiving each item or experience is clearly listed in the
        box description, so you can make informed choices. Contact
        support@onenightbox.com with questions.
      </p>
      <h3>Can I get a box for free?</h3>
      <p>
        We occasionally offer free boxes or promotional tokens as part of special
        events or sign-up bonuses! Check your "Wallet" for available tokens or
        follow our social media for giveaways. Standard boxes require a purchase
        with tokens or funds.
      </p>
      <h3>What happens if I don't like my item or experience?</h3>
      <p>
        You can exchange items or experiences for tokens via your
        "Pack" section within 14 days. Check the box description before purchasing
        to see exchange options. Defective items can be returned within 14 days
        for a replacement, subject to our Return Policy. Contact
        support@onenightbox.com for assistance.
      </p>
      <h3>Are there limits on how many boxes I can purchase?</h3>
      <p>
        There are no strict limits, but we encourage responsible
        purchasing. For security, your account may have daily or weekly
        transaction caps, which you can adjust in your settings. Contact
        support@onenightbox.com for help.
